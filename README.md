## The problem

The Cloud Computing industry is using 40 year old cryptographic algorithms and infrastructure, invented for a different era when client / server computing was the dominant paradigm.

As a result, DevOps teams inside cloud service providers encounter challenges scaling and automating data center operations when confronted with the complexities of running encryption, certificate and key management infrastructures built for a client / server era.

Cloud and software as a service providers encounter friction bringing the largest customers in regulated industries onto their platforms because issues of cryptograph trust, data residence and governance can't be adequately addressed.

Enterprises in regulated industries find challenges to fully transform themselves into digital businesses because the economics of cloud computing are unavailable to them.
